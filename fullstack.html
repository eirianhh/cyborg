    <h1> In my full-stack era </h1>
    <p> 
        Pursuing multiple disciplines in college, especially two very broad 
        disciplines, is simultaneously confusing and gratifying. 
        When I tell people in my information science classes that I have a paper, 
        the reaction is “I hate writing essays.” When I talk to my friends who are 
        humanities majors, they look at me like ??? 
        when I tell them they could use ChatGPT to figure something out. 
        My tech professors say “use copilot to figure it out before asking.” 
        My English professors say “don’t use ChatGPT ever.” #Confusing

        Funny thing is that I don’t think I’m that great at either. 
        However, the point is that I believe that having both tech and media literacy is equally of high importance.
         Being “full-stack” is truly the best way to get the best of both worlds
          (you’ll get that joke if you know CS, sorry). You’re able to learn about, 
          say, the societal implications of technology (esp. big tech) while knowing 
          how to prompt LLMs or understand how things work.

        So yes, I’m not the best at coding and don’t know any backend. 
        Many / most CS departments siphon their students into big tech, 
        so if you’re not into being a big tech big time software engineering 
        Bay Area whatever bro, there’s not much offered for you in terms of CS courses. Really makes you think.
