    <h4> Inspiration </h4>
    <p>
        I was inspired by several internet & digital media artists as well as numerous sources. My work is guided by
        current movements such as web brutalism, HTML zines, and general trends to create simple, HTML-driven websites
        that do not conform to current corporate UI/UX trends. Ultimately, the internet should be a fun place that is not 
        overrun by large corporations. There are no rules as to what websites should look like or who they should serve.
