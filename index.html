    <p> Welcome to my Feb 2025 website! Here is where I will be posting/hosting all of my 
        content for the month. Why I did this? Because I wanted to! This will only be up for a short while,
        then I will private this site. Exciting stuff. Feel free to click around. </p>
    <p> I am trying to be as simple as possible in my web design. Some may call it "unskilled" or "not UI,"
        but not me .. </p>

    <h2> articles I worked on this month </h2>
    <ul> 
      <li> Romeo + Juliet review. I hope the director sees it. </li>
      <li> First Date Conversation Starters </li>
    </ul>
