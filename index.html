    <header> <h1> what up February </h1>
  </header>
    <p> Welcome to my Feb 2025 (one-pager) website! Here is where I will be posting/hosting all of my 
        content for the month. Why I did this? I bored. This will only be up for a short while,
        then I will private this site. Exciting stuff. </p>
    <p> I am trying to be as simple as possible in my web design. Some may call it "lack of skill" or "not UI,"
        but not me .. </p>

    <h2> articles I wrote on this month </h2>
    <ul> 
      <li> Romeo + Juliet review. I hope the director sees it. </li>
      <li> First Date Conversation Starters </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> general life updates </h2>
    <p> 

    </p>
    
    <h2> other static html websites that inspired me </h2>
    <p> At some point, I would love to organize an HTML zine party where we get together and code.</p>
