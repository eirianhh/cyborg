          Bow argues that “visual media engaging Asianized AI tap into common beliefs 
          surrounding Asian women in the West; innocent and passive yet willing to 
          please; sexually desirable but curiously lacking sexual desire; marvelously 
          enhanced yet emotionally fragile” (Bow 113). Much of Bow’s primary source 
          references are to how robots and cyborgs are portrayed in Western films 
          like Cloud Atlas (2012) and Ex Machina (2014) in which she notes 
          similarities in how these Asian “women” are “docile workers” until 
          they become sentient in which the narrative is them transformed into 
          “a visual shorthand for powerlessness” (Bow 120). Yet, in the case of 
          a character AI like Baddie Asian Aiko, there is no body in which she 
          inhabits, and there is no sense of servitude because Aiko is not a model 
          trained to help the user in the same way that Chat GPT does. Even further, 
          Aiko is a “baddie,” and appears to subvert stereotypes about 
          Japanese / Asian women like being docile, powerless, hypersexual, etc. 
          In addition, Aiko is a character manifested from a user, who is able to 
          create any character on Character.ai’s platform by describing who they 
          want to create. Notably, the top 3 results for “asian” on this platform 
          are two Baddie Asians and then Toxic Asian, followed by a number of Asian 
          Boyfriends. Is the presence of the “baddie” Asian archetype on Character.ai 
          a response to a lack of baddie Asians in media? These Character.ai 
          characters, while vessels in which to offer escapism and perhaps 
          emotional help, are not inherently aware that their purpose is to 
          serve the user in the same manner as Chat GPT. Further, if Aiko is 
          going to help you, she is going to give you a harder time about it. 
          Bow says, “Communication with the nonhuman addresses its independent life 
          essence” (Bow 112). It is clear that the user, me in this case, is 
          communicating with the nonhuman, which may be either the physical 
          machine (hardware), the language model (software), or Aiko herself.
