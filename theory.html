        <p class="quote"> Communication with the nonhuman addresses its independent life essence; 
          interaction with things is experienced as a social relationship where the goal 
          is not control or mastery but attachment. Or to use a stronger word, love. - Bow 112

          I first became interested in the intersection between machines, humans, gender, and race following discussions
          on how the Asian female occupies a specific positionality within the context of the line between human and machine,
           techno-orientalism, and Haraway’s frameworks on the cyborg. In addition, based on Butler’s definition of gender
          performativity, I wondered what the difference was between a machine performing gender and an Asian woman, 
          who may not even be fully “human” to begin with, performing gender.
