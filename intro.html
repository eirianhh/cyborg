    <p class="quote"> Communication with the nonhuman addresses its independent life essence; 
      interaction with things is experienced as a social relationship where the goal 
      is not control or mastery but attachment. Or to use a stronger word, love. - Bow 112

      I first became interested in the intersection between machines, humans, gender, and race following discussions
      on how the Asian female occupies a specific positionality within the context of the line between human and machine,
       techno-orientalism, and Haraway’s frameworks on the cyborg. In addition, based on Butler’s definition of gender
      performativity, I wondered what the difference was between a machine performing gender and an Asian woman, 
      who may not even be fully “human” to begin with, performing gender. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      Much of humanities scholarship surrounding the topics of AI, 
      techno-orientalism, cyberfeminism, etc. lay in how, for example, 
      Asian women are depicted in Western film and other forms of literature. 
      On the other hand, most of the research or STEM-based scholarship surrounding 
      the topics of AI and gender revolve around how biases are coded into models 
      due to the datasets they are trained on being already biased, one of the 
      most notable being the 2018 study and project “Gender Shades” 
      by Joy Buolamwini. However, there is a certain tension between how the 
      humanities treat AI and how STEM treats AI. This became especially 
      apparent for me this semester where I took a class titled 
      “AI and Storytelling,” where my (visiting) professor assigned us assignments 
      in which we were required to test various prompts in order to generate stories,
       then measure how good certain models were at doing so (amongst a slew of 
       other related projects and assignments). 
       Most interestingly was the course’s AI Policy: </p>
<p class="block"> This class is about how to use AI critically to understand the world better and foster your own creativity and critical thinking. Therefore, it is an "ALL AI" policy, meaning you may use AI for any assignment to whatever extent you wish to submit the best possible assignment. </p>
<p> While this is certainly an extreme, in my information science classes, 
  this was becoming more of the norm. I was encouraged in another class to 
  use AI as an aid while coding, and to cite my usage and evaluation of the output. 
  However, in my English classes, the opposite could not be more apparent. 
  Because I had the unique opportunity to learn in both of these environments, 
  I sought out to find areas in which there would be possibilities to bridge 
  these two polarized perspectives on the either bleak or promising future of AI. 
</p>

<p> This project is not so much as focused on the AI’s ethics or morals, 
  but rather the ways in which humans and AI are interacting despite current 
  contentions. Prior to the widespread usage of generative AI 
  (otherwise called the AI boom), voice assistants like Siri and Alexa are likely 
  what most people were familiar with when it comes to artificial intelligence. 
  While these programs are different from modes like Chat GPT, they serve as an 
  important introduction to how there is an inexplicable link between gender and machines. Besides the somewhat obvious observation that if someone were to create a character for a tool that is solely meant to serve humans as efficiently as possible it would obviously be a woman, there is also the without can manifest itself in the form of violence against things that are gendered as women. 
</p>

<p> 
  Bow defines techno-orientalism as “tech feeling as anti-Asian bias” (Bow 111). Techno-orientalism can be defined as “the projection of an Asianized, simulated future coincident with Japanese innovations in electronics, automobiles, gaming, AI and robotics in the 1980s” and has “come to refer to a futurist aesthetic, cyberpunk or otherwise” (Bow 111). Through an interactive statically coded webpage, I aim to explore how various LLMs are able to perform gender. Are there inherencies that these models latch on to? Is the rapid advancement of AI allowing machines and humans to converge in the way that we are sharing knowledge, or is AI diverging from human bounds of knowledge and abilities? Further, by casting my work into a simply coded static website done completely with HTML/CSS,  (or webzine, another objective I have is to force an interaction between the user (human) and the machine (my work). This medium, which could also be categorized as a digital zine or an interactive essay, blends technology with the humanities in a non-trivial, interactive, and non-corporatized way. 
</p>

<p> Ultimately, my hope is that users are inspired to reflect on their relationship with AI, interact with AI in different ways, or at least develop a more nuanced perspective of it. While there are conflicting viewpoints on the sanctity of AI, especially when it comes to bias, ethics, environmental concerns, big tech, and more, I hope that my work can contribute to current dialogues on how humans and machines interact with one another.
