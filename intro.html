    In Bow’s article, she writes that “If the US Constitution counted enslaved persons as part human, as three-fifths of a person, in twentieth-century and millennial dystopic imaginings of forced servitude, the other two-fifths is, of course, machine” (122). Butler’s long-standing theory is that gender is an imitation and a constant act of repeating norms. Combining both of these ideas and supplementing with notes from Haraway’s text, my project will attempt to expand on and put into practice Bow’s exploration of “a future in which both slaves and robots have become Asian women” (Bow 116). If humans are already part machine, and all technology is somewhat part human (in the way that all existing technologies were produced out of human desire), then what are the distinctions between an Asian woman and an AI-generated one? If an Asian woman is (part) robot, then is robot also somewhat part Asian woman? Can AI also perform gender (and race)?

    <p> My project will mostly consist of a conversation between me and a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT. Through my prompts, I aim to explore multiple facets of female Asian identity that relate to Haraway and Bow’s ideas on cyborg, techno-orientalism, the posthuman, and social robotics. If AI is already being viewed as a threat to human productivity, labor, and more, then there could be a link made between how LLMs mirror human behavior. My ultimate goal is to transfer my interactions with AI to an interactive website or otherwise engaging visual stimulating digital medium, highlighting how Asian women “have become hyperreal” (Bow). For example, I will first prompt a LLM to embody an Asian woman, then ask it a slew of questions in which it will respond as such. Presenting my results in the form of a website / digital artifact forces the person viewing my work to also interact with a computer and measure the LLM’s performativity. It could also be interesting to engage multiple LLMs, like Chat GPT, Llama, and/or Claude.
